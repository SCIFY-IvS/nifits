Changelog for oifits python module

0.3.3 (2016-03-10)

    * Fixed an error with the formatting of target tables, which was
    causing problems when reading oifits files created by the python
    module in LITpro.

    * Removed calls to deprecated pyfits (3.3) code and numpy code.

    * If pyfits is not found, look for it in astropy.
